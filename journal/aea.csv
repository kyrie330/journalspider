"We study how voter turnout affects the aggregation of preferences in elections. Under voluntary voting, election outcomes disproportionately aggregate the preferences of voters with low voting cost and high preference intensity. We show identification of the correlation structure among preferences, costs, and perceptions of voting efficacy, and explore how the correlation affects preference aggregation. Using 2004 US presidential election data, we find that young, low-income, less-educated, and minority voters are underrepresented. All of these groups tend to prefer Democrats, except for the less educated. Democrats would have won the majority of the electoral votes if all eligible voters had turned out.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190063,Kei Kawai; Yuta Toyama; Yasutora Watanabe,13 (4): 548-86,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190063,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,Voter Turnout and Preference Aggregation
This paper investigates the how government outsourcing affects efficiency and expenditures by considering how outsourcing decisions are determined along two dimensions: (i) cost differences between private firms and government suppliers of public goods and (ii) dynamics arising from cost complementarities and capacity constraints. I formulate and estimate a dynamic model of government outsourcing using project-level data from the dredging industry. Model estimates indicate substantial cost savings due to outsourcing but also that government presence in the market yields cost reduction. A counterfactual policy featuring direct competition between government and private sector firms finds a total expenditure reduction of 15.7 percent.,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190018,Aaron Barkley,13 (4): 514-47,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190018,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,Cost and Efficiency in Government Outsourcing: Evidence from the Dredging Industry
"The steady rise in income and wealth inequality in the last four decades, together with the evolution of a vanishing middle class, has raised concerns about potentially pernicious effects of these trends on social stability and economic growth. This paper evaluates the possibility of designing tax systems aimed at reducing income inequality and bipolarization. Using two fundamentally different metrics, we provide a unified foundation of tax progressivity whereby, roughly, taxes are progressive if and only if they are inequality reducing; and taxes are inequality reducing if and only if they are bipolarization reducing.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190111,Oriol Carbonell-Nicolau; Humberto Llavador,13 (4): 492-513,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190111,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,"Inequality, Bipolarization, and Tax Progressivity"
"We study fairness in economies where humans consume one private good and one public good representing the welfare of other species. We show that a social evaluator cannot be egalitarian with respect to humans while always respecting humans' unanimous preferences. One solution is to respect unanimous preferences only when doing so does not lead to a decrease in the welfare of other species. Social preferences satisfying these properties reveal surprising connections between concerns for other species, egalitarianism among humans, and unanimity: the latter two imply a form of dictatorship from humans with the strongest preference for the welfare of other species.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190091,Marc Fleurbaey; Martin Van der Linden,13 (4): 466-91,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190091,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,"Fair Social Ordering, Egalitarianism, and Animal Welfare"
"We study how to orchestrate information acquisition in an environment where bidders endowed with original estimates (""types"") about their private values can acquire further information by incurring a cost. We consider both single-round and fully sequential short-listing rules. The optimal single-round shortlisting rule admits the set of most efficient bidders that maximizes expected virtual surplus adjusted by the second-stage signal and information acquisition cost. When shortlisting is fully sequential, at each round, the most efficient remaining bidder is admitted provided that her conditional expected contribution to the virtual surplus is positive.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190114,Jingfeng Lu; Lixin Ye; Xin Feng,13 (4): 420-65,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190114,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,Orchestrating Information Acquisition
"We investigate information aggregation and competition in a delegation framework. An uninformed principal is unable to perform a task herself and must choose between one of two biased and imperfectly informed experts. In the focal equilibrium, experts exaggerate their biases, anticipating an ideological winner's curse. We show that having a second expert can benefit the principal, even when equally or more biased than the first expert. The principal can benefit from commitment to an ""element of surprise"" and prefers experts with equal rather than opposite biases.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190008,Attila Ambrus; Volodymyr Baranovskyi; Aaron Kolb,13 (4): 373-419,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190008,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,A Delegation-Based Theory of Expertise
"Recent developments in social media have morphed the age-old practice of paying influential individuals for product endorsements into a multibillion dollar industry, extending well beyond celebrity sponsorships. We develop a parsimonious model in which influencers trade off the increased revenue they obtain from paid endorsements with the negative impact that these have on their followers' engagement and, therefore, on the price influencers receive from marketers. The model provides testable predictions that match suggestive evidence on pricing of paid endorsements, reveals a novel type of inefficiency that emerges in this market, and clarifies the role of search technology and advice transparency in shaping market activity. In particular, we show that recent policies that make paid endorsements more transparent can backfire, whereas an increase in the effectiveness of the search technology that matches followers to influencers has both direct and strategic positive welfare effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20200050,Itay P.

"A principal owns a firm, hires an agent of uncertain productivity, and designs a dynamic policy for evaluating his performance. The agent observes ongoing evaluations and decides when to quit. When not quitting, the agent is paid a wage that is linear in his expected productivity; the principal claims the residual performance. After quitting, the players secure fixed outside options. I show that equilibrium is Pareto efficient. For a broad class of performance technologies, the equilibrium wage deterministically grows with tenure. My analysis suggests that endogenous performance evaluation plays an important role in shaping careers in organizations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20170405,Alex Smolin,13 (4): 300-331,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20170405,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,Dynamic Evaluation Design
"Most institutions are limited in scope. We study experimentally how enforcement institutions affect behavior, preferences, and beliefs beyond their direct influence over the behaviors they control. Groups play two identical public good games, with cooperation institutionally enforced in one game. Institutions generally have economically significant positive spillover effects to the unregulated game. We also observe that institutions enhance conditional cooperation preferences and beliefs about others' cooperativeness, suggesting that both factors are drivers of observed spillover effects. In additional treatments, we provide evidence for several factors, including characteristics of institutions, that enhance or limit the effectiveness and scope of spillover effects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20180336,Florian Engl; Arno Riedl; Roberto Weber,13 (4): 261-99,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20180336,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,"Spillover Effects of Institutions on Cooperative Behavior, Preferences, and Beliefs"
"Copyrights, which establish intellectual property in music, science, and other creative goods, are intended to encourage creativity. Yet, copyrights also raise the cost of accessing existing work¡ªpotentially discouraging future innovation. This paper uses an exogenous shift toward weak copyrights (and low access costs) during World War II to examine the potentially adverse effects of copyrights on science. Using two alternative identification strategies, we show that weaker copyrights encouraged the creation of follow-on science, measured by citations. This change is driven by a reduction in access costs, allowing scientists at less affluent institutions to use existing knowledge in new follow-on research.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190113,Barbara Biasi; Petra Moser,13 (4): 218-60,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190113,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,Effects of Copyrights on Science: Evidence from the WWII Book Republication Program
"We propose a simple method, requiring only minimal data, for bounding demand elasticities in growing, homogeneous-product markets. Since growing demand curves cannot cross, shifts in market equilibrium over time can be used to ""funnel"" the demand curve into a narrow region, bounding its slope. Our featured application assesses the antitrust remedy in the 1952 DuPont decision, ordering incumbents to license patents for commercial plastics. We bound the demand elasticity significantly below 1 in many post-remedy years, inconsistent with monopoly, supporting the remedy's effectiveness. A second application investigates whether the 1911 dissolution of American Tobacco fostered competition in the cigarette market.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190012,Wallace P.

"The prospect of capital obsolescence inhibits investment. Investors thus become more optimistic when the obsolescence of their capital slows down. We propose a model with no fixed costs of investment, and random technological progress that induces obsolescence of capital in place. Spikes occur precisely when technological progress slows down. Moreover, the more variable the progress, the larger are the spikes. Cross-industry data show that where price of capital declines are more variable, investment spikes are larger.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190062,Arthur Fishman; Boyan Jovanovic,13 (4): 135-71,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190062,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,Obsolescence of Capital and Investment Spikes
"We study efficient exclusion policies in a canonical credit model that features both exogenous and strategic default along the equilibrium path. Policies that maximize welfare in a stationary equilibrium implement exclusion for a finite and deterministic number of periods following default. Front-loading exclusion makes the mass of socially valuable transactions as high as it can be in steady state. Less intuitively, doing so also maximizes the average welfare of excluded agents in equilibrium conditional on the level of incentives provided by the threat of exclusion. We argue that these results are robust to a host of natural variations on our benchmark model.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190005,Cyril Monnet; Erwan Quintin,13 (4): 101-34,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190005,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,Optimal Financial Exclusion
"We develop a model wherein concerns about prosecutor quality reduce the willingness of witnesses to cooperate with prosecutors. This causes an increase in the crime rate and in wrongly convicted innocent defendants. Because citizens are taxpayers and may be victims, perpetrators, witnesses, or falsely accused defendants, they care about the prosecutor's quality. They update beliefs about this quality based on the disposition of cases. If the prosecutor's believed quality falls below a threshold, then a majority of voters chooses to replace the prosecutor with a challenger, in expectation of reform. We compare the majority's choice with that of a social planner.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20200039,Andrew F. Daughety; Jennifer F.

"This paper develops a dynamic structural model of trade in which firms slowly accumulate consumers in foreign markets. Estimating the model using export data from individual firms and a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo estimator, the model predicts lower survival rates for new exporters and estimates low entry costs of exporting¡ªless than half of those estimated in the absence of consumer accumulation. Using simulations and out-of-sample predictions, I show that the introduction of such frictions and the reduction in estimated entry costs allow the model to match important facts regarding the aggregate response of international trade to shocks.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190051,Paul Piveteau,13 (4): 23-63,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/655,,DOI: 10.1257/mic.20190051,American Economic Journal: Microeconomics,An Empirical Dynamic Model of Trade with Consumer Accumulation
"We examine a common value dynamic matching environment where adverse selection accrues slowly over time. Theoretical best responses are therefore time varying, and the prior experimental literature suggests that sequential environments might lead to greater understanding of adverse selection in this dynamic setting. However, while a sophisticated minority in our experiment do condition on time and are close to a best response, the majority use a stationary response, even after extended experience. In an environment with persistent uncertainty, our results indicate that sequentiality is insufficient for the large majority of participants to recognize the effects of adverse selection.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.20190088,Felipe A.

"Using high-frequency data for sovereign long-term bond yields and five-year credit default swap spreads, we estimate a regression model to identify a nonlinear link between cross-section deviation of market yield and extreme movements in African markets and other regions. Results indicate that African sovereign bonds have been subject to herding.

Native Americans have 3.5 times the COVID-19 infection rate and 1.5 times the death rate of non-Hispanic Whites. We demonstrate that social distancing policies may have unanticipated effects on behaviors. We estimate the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on the types of grocery stores visited by individuals residing on and off of American Indian reservations during the pandemic. We find that there is a larger reduction in the distance traveled to grocery stores for on-reservation households than for off-reservation households. We also find an increase in the relative share of trips to convenience stores for reservation residents.,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211117,Luis Quintero; Emilia Simeonova; Randall Akee,111: 602-06,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/635,,DOI: 10.1257/pandp.20211117,AEA Papers and Proceedings,"Pandemic Protocols, Native Nutrition: Grocery Store Access from American Indian Reservations during COVID-19"
"Many medical professionals left Puerto Rico due to the financial crisis. Puerto Rico passed Act 14 in April 2017 to mitigate the exodus of physicians, reducing the flat tax on medical services to 4 percent. The same year, Puerto Rico was devastated by a Category 4 hurricane, leaving the island without power for several months. A difference-in-difference model is used to estimate the net effects of the hurricane and Act 14 on the number of health-care providers.

"We examine how firms adjust their labor demand to immigration policy changes resulting from intensified interior immigration enforcement. Using the temporal and geographic variation in the adoption of such policies as a source of identification, we find that firms boost their demand for low-skilled foreign-born labor under the H-2B visa program as enforcement intensifies. Furthermore, firms' increased demand for guest workers is inversely related to natives' employment in occupations where most H-2B workers are hired; however, it does not seem to alter natives' wages or work hours, nor does it seem to redistribute native labor away from those occupations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211115,Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes; Esther Arenas-Arroyo; Bernhard Schmidpeter,111: 593-97,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/635,,DOI: 10.1257/pandp.20211115,AEA Papers and Proceedings,Immigration Enforcement and the Hiring of Low-Skilled Labor
We document new stylized facts on the occupational mix of businesses in the United States and how their internal organization evolves over their life cycles. Our main empirical finding is that younger businesses have fewer hierarchical layers and lower span of control than comparable older businesses do. Our results suggest that businesses become simultaneously more hierarchical and increase their managerial span of control over their life cycles. We show that this pattern is not entirely driven by selection or differences in size and is pervasive across cohorts and sectors.,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211121,Elizabeth Weber Handwerker; Sara Moreira; David Piccone Jr.,111: 587-92,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/635,,DOI: 10.1257/pandp.20211121,AEA Papers and Proceedings,The Life Cycle of Businesses and Their Internal Organization
"We complement the literature on common ownership by presenting two new observations from entrepreneurial start-ups. First, given the increase in common ownership of start-ups by venture capital investors, inclusion of high-value start-ups in standard common ownership measures may actually increase aggregate measures of common ownership. Second, we suggest that even if public-firm common ownership leads to collusive inefficiency and higher prices in the short term, it may also create opportunities for entry of innovative high-growth start-ups. Consistent with this, we document that entrepreneurial activity and common ownership of start-ups tends to be higher in industries with higher common ownership among public firms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211120,Ofer Eldar; Jillian Grennan,111: 582-86,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/635,,DOI: 10.1257/pandp.20211120,AEA Papers and Proceedings,Common Ownership and Entrepreneurship
"Successful innovation is essential for the survival and growth of organizations, but how best to incentivize innovation is poorly understood. We compare how two common incentive schemes affect innovative performance in a field experiment run in partnership with a large life sciences company. We find that a winner-takes-all compensation scheme generates significantly more novel innovation relative to a compensation scheme that offers the same total compensation but shares it across the ten best innovations. Moreover, the winner-takes-all scheme does not reduce innovative output on average and, among teams of innovators, generates more output than the less risky prize structure.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211119,Joshua Graff Zivin; Elizabeth Lyons,111: 577-81,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/635,,DOI: 10.1257/pandp.20211119,AEA Papers and Proceedings,The Effects of Prize Structures on Innovative Performance
"To solicit information from a social network in urban Monrovia, Liberia, we ask community members to assess their neighbors' poverty and assist in targeting a cash transfer. We find little evidence that local leaders, randomly selected neighbors, or neighbors nominated by fellow community members can accurately assess whether others in their community are among the poorest.

"There is growing interest in market design using default rules and other ""choice architecture"" principles to steer consumers toward desirable outcomes. Using data from Massachusetts's health insurance exchange, we study an ""automatic retention"" policy intended to prevent coverage interruptions among low-income enrollees. Rather than disenroll people who lapse in paying premiums, the policy automatically switches them to an available free plan until they actively cancel or lose eligibility. We find that automatic retention has a sizable impact, switching 14 percent of consumers annually and differentially retaining healthy, low-cost individuals.

"In markets with complicated products such as insurance, why do firms offer many products even when consumers appear to receive little benefit? We show that when consumers face information acquisition costs, firms may have an incentive to introduce many undifferentiated products. This allows firms to gain market share and increase markups. We document initial evidence consistent with the model using data from Medicare prescription drug insurance. Insurers that offer more duplicate or similar plans have higher-cost plans.

"We combine a spatial model of innovation with Hotelling's model of competition. Innovations are vertically and also horizontally differentiated. Potential innovators choose not only whether to innovate but also how to innovate. The bolder they are with a new product, the riskier is the outcome but the softer will be the resulting market competition with existing products. We use the model to explore the interaction of competition and innovation and address several classic questions.

I describe events leading to the veto and through the bank's dissolution in 1836 using private correspondence and official government documents. These sources reveal a political process through which charges against the bank took hold, accomplices and backup plans were lined up, and the bank was ultimately destroyed with the assistance of chartered banks in New York City. Although the aggressive means by which the bank was dismantled led to a system-wide financial failure and recession in the short term, the long-run outcome was likely a wider diffusion of banking services and a more efficient allocation of capital.

Using expected national wind production as an instrument for price, we estimate household-level demand elasticities for RTP households and non-RTP (placebo) households. Estimates show no difference in behavior across RTP and non-RTP households. Reasons for nonresponse may include low potential gains or high nonmonetary costs of information acquisition and behavioral change. We discuss implications for optimal dynamic electricity pricing.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211007,Natalia Fabra; David Rapson; Mar Reguant; Jingyuan Wang,111: 425-29,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/635,,DOI: 10.1257/pandp.20211007,AEA Papers and Proceedings,Estimating the Elasticity to Real-Time Pricing: Evidence from the Spanish Electricity Market
"In Delhi, one of the world's most polluted cities, there is relatively little information on indoor air pollution and how it varies by socioeconomic status (SES). Using indoor air quality monitors (IAQMs), we find that winter levels of household air pollution exceed World Health Organization standards by more than 20 times in both high- and low-SES households. We then evaluate a field experiment that randomly assigned monthlong IAQM user trials across medium- and high-SES households but suffered from significant survey non-response.

"This paper examines the link between electoral incentives and environmental degradation by exploiting a satellite dataset on 107,000 forest fires and 879 asynchronous district elections in Indonesia. Fires represent a cheap but illegal means of converting forested land to other uses, but they risk burning out of control and creating substantial negative environmental externalities. We find a significant electoral cycle in forest fires. Ignitions and area burned decline during election years but steeply increase in the year after.

Do US air pollution offset markets disproportionately relocate pollution to or from low-income or minority communities? Concerns about an equal distribution of environmental quality across communities¡ªenvironmental justice¡ªhave growing policy influence. We relate prices and quantities of offset transactions to the demographics of the communities surrounding polluting plants. We find little association of offset prices or offset-induced movements in pollution with the share of a community that is Black or Hispanic or with mean household income. This analysis of 12 prominent offset markets suggests that they do not substantially increase or decrease the equity of environmental outcomes.,https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211004,Joseph S.

"Martin and Zhang (2020) show that the increase in manufacturing output in China's special economic zones significantly increased air pollution. In this complementary paper, we document that widespread migration into these industrial clusters between 2000 and 2010 did little to change overall population exposure to pollution. We show using satellite air pollution data that there is much heterogeneity across zones and that most population growth occurred in relatively cleaner zones, supporting recent literature that documents local willingness to make location decisions based on environmental quality (Chen et al. 2019, Khanna et al. 2020).",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211074,Leslie A.

"Governments taxing carbon emissions within their jurisdiction can impose a commensurate tax on emissions embodied in imports in order to mitigate emissions leakage. California offers a rare opportunity to investigate how such a border carbon adjustment (BCA) is working in practice. Experience to date highlights important tensions between greenhouse gas accounting accuracy, market efficiency, and concerns about trade protectionism.

"In this paper, we show that the pandemic recession has led to frequent cuts in nominal wages. Within three months in 2020, as many wage cuts had occurred as occurred throughout the Great Recession. Unlike employment declines, wage cuts were concentrated at the top of the wage distribution. However, these cuts have been relatively short lived, particularly among high earners. Finally, wage cuts have been concentrated in firms that have seen large employment declines. Wage cuts appear not to be a substitute for cutting employment, at least when the shock to labor demand is this large.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211056,John Grigsby; Erik Hurst; Ahu Yildirmaz; Yulia Zhestkova,111: 258-62,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/635,,DOI: 10.1257/pandp.20211056,AEA Papers and Proceedings,Nominal Wage Adjustments during the Pandemic Recession
"The trajectory of new business applications and transitions to employer businesses differs markedly during the Great Recession and the COVID-19 recession. Both applications and transitions to employer start-ups decreased slowly but persistently in the post-Lehman crisis period of the Great Recession. In contrast, during the COVID-19 recession, new applications initially declined but have since sharply rebounded, resulting in a surge in applications during 2020. Projected transitions to employer businesses also rise, but this is dampened by a change in the composition of applications in 2020 toward applications that are more likely to be nonemployers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211055,Emin Dinlersoz; Timothy Dunne; John Haltiwanger; Veronika Penciakova,111: 253-57,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/635,,DOI: 10.1257/pandp.20211055,AEA Papers and Proceedings,Business Formation: A Tale of Two Recessions
"Harmonized commercial laws are considered an essential ingredient to commerce and trade and have been called the backbone of American commerce.

"We conducted a randomized control trial with nearly 1,000 students to test whether using a text-message-based tool that provides small commitments with social accountability helps students procrastinate less and maintain engagement with course material, yielding improved academic performance. All students received identical content via text message, but the treatment group engaged with an online platform encouraging commitments and featuring a social feed with rankings. The analysis reveals that microcommitments with social accountability improved academic performance relative to students who received simple nudges. The increase is equivalent to 3 percentage points on an exam, driven by online and hybrid classes.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20211043,Amanda J. Felkey; Eva Dziadula; Eric P.

"We examine the process underlying field specialization among beginning economists. Our multivariate logit framework accommodates single- and dual-field specializations with correlated choices. Including field-specific relative salaries and expected probabilities of academic employment is a novel aspect of this research. After conditioning on personal, economic, and institutional variables, we find that women graduate students are less likely to specialize in labor/health, macro/finance, industrial organization, public economics, and development/growth/international fields and are more likely to specialize in agricultural/resource/environmental fields.

This paper examines one potential mechanism, namely that CeMENT expanded the collaboration networks of the participants. Our analysis finds that women who received the mentoring treatment had 3 additional pre-tenure coauthors, 1.6 more pre-tenure publications, and 43 additional citations to those publications. After controlling for additional coauthors, the CeMENT program increased publications and top-tier publications.

"Algorithmic decision-making can lead to discrimination against legally protected groups, but measuring such discrimination is often hampered by a fundamental selection challenge. We develop new quasi-experimental tools to overcome this challenge and measure algorithmic discrimination in pretrial bail decisions. We show that the selection challenge reduces to the challenge of measuring four moments, which can be estimated by extrapolating quasi-experimental variation across as-good-as-randomly assigned decision-makers.

"This paper argues that the social nature of humans, absent from the standard economic model, is crucial for understanding our large modern social states and why concerns about inequality are so pervasive. A social solution arises when a situation is resolved at the group level (rather than the individual level) through cooperation and fair distribution of the resulting surplus. In human societies, childcare and education for the young, retirement benefits for the old, health care for the sick, and income support for those in need are resolved at the social level and through the social state in advanced economies.

"Industrial agglomeration policies may limit competition. We develop, validate, and apply a novel approach for measuring competition based on the comovement of markups and market shares among firms in the same location and industry. Then we develop a model of how this reduction in competition affects aggregate income. We apply our approach to the well-known special economic zones (SEZs) of China. We estimate that firms in SEZs exhibit cooperative pricing almost three times as intensively as firms outside SEZs. Nevertheless, we model the aggregate consequences of SEZs and find positive effects because markups become higher but also more equal.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20180443,Wyatt J.

"Many countries shift substantial public resources across jurisdictions to mitigate spatial economic disparities. We use a general equilibrium model with multiple asymmetric regions, labor mobility, and costly trade to carve out the aggregate implications of fiscal transfers. Calibrating the model for Germany, we find that transfers indeed deliver smaller disparities across regions. This comes at the cost of lower national output, however, because economic activity is diverted away from core cities and toward remote areas with low productivity. But despite this loss in output per capita by about 2 percent in our baseline specification, welfare still increases by 0.07 percent because the transfer scheme countervails overcongestion in large cities. If the optimal transfer regime was implemented, welfare would increase by 0.06 percent.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180294,Marcel Henkel; Tobias Seidel; Jens Suedekum,13 (4): 433-68,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/656,,DOI: 10.1257/pol.20180294,American Economic Journal: Economic Policy,Fiscal Transfers in the Spatial Economy
"This paper uses new, large-scale vehicle registry data from Norway and a two-sided market framework to show nonneutrality of different subsidies and estimate their impact on electric vehicle adoption when network externalities are present.

Counterfactual analyses suggest that between 2010 and 2015, every dollar spent on station subsidies resulted in more than twice as many additional electric vehicle purchases than the same amount spent on price subsidies.

"This article analyzes concerns about market power and inequality in a model with multiple sectors, heterogeneous abilities, endogenous labor supply, and nonlinear income taxation. Proportional markups with no profit dissipation have no effect on the economy, and a policy that reduces a nonproportional markup raises (lowers) welfare when it is higher (lower) than a weighted average of other markups. With proportional (partial or full) profit dissipation, proportional markups are equivalent to a downward shift of the distribution of abilities, and the optimal policy rule with nonproportional markups maximizes consumer plus producer surplus despite concerns for distribution and labor supply distortion.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20200103,Louis Kaplow,13 (4): 329-54,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/656,,DOI: 10.1257/pol.20200103,American Economic Journal: Economic Policy,Market Power and Income Taxation

"Participants in means-tested programs must periodically document eligibility through a recertification process.

The consequences of not recertifying due to later interviews are highly skewed: most cases quickly reenroll, while one-quarter remain off SNAP for over a year.

Using variation from the program's eligibility cutoffs and the rollout of the subsidy program, the program is found to boost sales for subsidized vehicle models, but also to create a substitution effect within highly fuel-efficient vehicles.

"This study documents the presence of local protectionism and quantifies its impacts on market competition and social welfare in the context of China's automobile market. A salient feature of China's auto market is that vehicle models by joint ventures and state-owned enterprises command much higher market shares in their headquarter provinces than at the national level. Through county border analysis, falsification tests, and a consumer survey, we uncover protectionist policies such as subsidies to local brands as the primary contributing factor to the observed home bias. We then set up and estimate a market equilibrium model to quantify the impact of local protection, controlling for other demand and supply factors. Counterfactual analysis shows that local protection leads to significant consumer choice distortions and results in 21.9 billion yuan of consumer welfare loss, amounting to 41 percent of total subsidy.

"How should developing countries tax corporate income? We study this question in Costa Rica, where firms face higher average tax rates on profits when revenues marginally increase. We combine discontinuity and bunching designs to estimate the elasticity of taxable profit and separate it into revenue and cost elasticities. We find that firms faced with a higher tax rate slightly reduce revenues but considerably increase costs, thus producing a large elasticity of taxable profit of 3¨C5. In this context, the revenue-maximizing rate for a corporate tax on profit is below 25 percent, and we show that a tax policy that broadens the base while lowering the rate can almost double the tax revenue collected from these firms.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20180564,Pierre Bachas; Mauricio Soto,13 (4): 36-71,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/656,,DOI: 10.1257/pol.20180564,American Economic Journal: Economic Policy,Corporate Taxation under Weak Enforcement
"If online transactions are tax free, increased online shopping may lower tax rates as jurisdictions seek to reduce tax avoidance; but, if online firms remit taxes, online sales may put upward pressure on tax rates because internet sales help enforce destination-based taxes. I find that higher internet penetration generally results in lower municipal tax rates but raises tax rates in some jurisdictions. The latter effect emerges in states where many online vendors remit taxes. A 1 standard deviation increase in internet penetration lowers local sales taxes in large municipalities by 0.15 percentage points, or 16 percent of the average rate.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20170094,David R.

"We document a decline in the frequency of shopping trips in the United States since 1980 and consider its implications for the measurement of consumption inequality. A decline in shopping frequency as households stock up on storable goods (i.e., inventory behavior) will lead to a rise in expenditure inequality when the latter is measured at high frequency, even when underlying consumption inequality is unchanged. We find that most of the recently documented rise in expenditure inequality in the United States since the 1980s can be accounted for by this phenomenon. Using detailed micro data on spending, which we link to data on club/warehouse store openings, we directly attribute much of the reduced frequency of shopping trips to the rise in club/warehouse stores.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20190115,Olivier Coibion; Yuriy Gorodnichenko; Dmitri Koustas,13 (4): 449-82,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/651,,DOI: 10.1257/mac.20190115,American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics,Consumption Inequality and the Frequency of Purchases
"Trading frictions in financial markets affect more long-term than short-term bonds, generating an upward-sloping yield curve. Long-term financing is more expensive in economies with higher trading frictions so firms choose to borrow and invest in shorter horizons and lower productivity projects. The theory guides a new identification of the slope of liquidity spread in the data. We measure and calibrate the model for the United States, and counterfactual exercises suggest that variations in trading frictions can have significant effects on maturity choices and investment. A policy intervention improves liquidity, reduces long-term financial costs, and promotes investment in longer-term projects.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20190353,Julian Kozlowski,13 (4): 411-48,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/651,,DOI: 10.1257/mac.20190353,American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics,Long-Term Finance and Investment with Frictional Asset Markets
"Uncertainty about the future rises in recessions. But is uncertainty a source of business cycles or an endogenous response to them, and does the type of uncertainty matter? We propose a novel SVAR identification strategy to address these questions via inequality constraints on the structural shocks. We find that sharply higher macroeconomic uncertainty in recessions is often an endogenous response to output shocks, while uncertainty about financial markets is a likely source of output fluctuations.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20190171,Sydney C.

"How large are the aggregate productivity losses from the misallocation of resources across firms? With endogenous selection, microfrictions can induce extensive margin misallocation among firms: too many unproductive firms are active (Zombies), and too many productive firms are inactive (Shadows). Therefore, the same set of measured distortions potentially induces much larger aggregate productivity losses, as the composition of firms is shifted toward unproductive active firms. I develop and calibrate a model with plant-level microdata for Indonesia to quantify aggregate welfare in the presence of extensive margin misallocation. My estimates show that selection can magnify aggregate TFP losses from microdistortions by over 40 percent compared to existing estimates. Realistic values of measurement error even increase the relative importance of extensive margin misallocation.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20160253,Mu-Jeung Yang,13 (4): 341-68,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/651,,DOI: 10.1257/mac.20160253,American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics,Micro-level Misallocation and Selection
"We propose a model of banks' exposure to movements in interest rates and their role in the transmission of monetary shocks. Since bank deposits provide liquidity, higher interest rates allow banks to earn larger spreads on deposits. Therefore, if risk aversion is higher than one, banks' optimal dynamic hedging strategy is to take losses when interest rates rise. This risk exposure can be achieved by a traditional maturity-mismatched balance sheet and amplifies the effects of monetary shocks on the cost of liquidity. The model can match the level, time pattern, and cross-sectional pattern of banks' maturity mismatch.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20180379,Sebastian Di Tella; Pablo Kurlat,13 (4): 295-340,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/651,,DOI: 10.1257/mac.20180379,American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics,Why Are Banks Exposed to Monetary Policy?

For our leading example, there exists a unique equilibrium where the value of money increases over time and reaches a steady state. There is also a continuum of perfect-foresight equilibria where the price of money inflates and bursts gradually over time.

"To quantify trade frictions, we examine multiproduct exporters. We build a flexible general-equilibrium model and estimate market entry costs using Brazilian firm-product-destination data under rich demand and market access cost shocks. Our estimates show that additional products farther from a firm's core competency come at higher production costs, but there are substantive economies of scope in market access costs. Market access costs differ across destinations, falling more rapidly in scope at nearby regions and at destinations with fewer nontariff barriers.

"Financial crises are particularly severe and lengthy when banks fail to recapitalize after bearing large losses. We present a model that explains the slow recovery of bank capital and economic activity. Banks provide intermediation in markets with information asymmetries. Large equity losses force banks to tighten intermediation, which exacerbates adverse selection. Adverse selection lowers bank profit margins, which slows both the internal growth of equity and equity injections. This mechanism generates financial crises characterized by persistent low growth. The lack of equity injections during crises is a coordination failure that is solved when the decision to recapitalize banks is centralized.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20160286,Saki Bigio; Adrien d'Avernas,13 (4): 142-81,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/651,,DOI: 10.1257/mac.20160286,American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics,Financial Risk Capacity

"We develop a model where selection into marriage and household search generate a marital wage premium. Beyond selection, married individuals earn higher wages for two reasons. First, income pooling within a joint household raises risk-averse individuals' reservation wages. Second, married individuals climb the job ladder faster, as they internalize that higher wages increase their partner's selectivity over offers. Specialization according to comparative advantage in search generates a premium that increases in spousal education, as in the data. Quantitatively, household search explains 10¨C33 percent and 20¨C58 percent of the premium for males and females, respectively, and accounts for its increase with spousal education.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20180092,Laura Pilossoph; Shu Lin Wee,13 (4): 55-109,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/651,,DOI: 10.1257/mac.20180092,American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics,Household Search and the Marital Wage Premium
"We use sizable lottery prizes in Norwegian administrative panel data to explore how transitory income shocks are spent and saved over time and how households' marginal propensities to consume (MPCs) vary with household characteristics and shock size. We find that spending peaks in the year of winning and gradually reverts to normal within five years. Controlling for all items on households' balance sheets and characteristics such as education and income, it is the amount won, age, and liquid assets that vary systematically with MPCs. Low-liquidity winners of the smallest prizes (around US$1,500) are estimated to spend all within the year of winning. The corresponding estimate for high-liquidity winners of large prizes (US$8,300¨C150,000) is slightly below one-half. While conventional models will struggle to account for such high MPC levels, we show that a two-asset life cycle model with a realistic earnings profile and a luxury bequest motive can account for both the time profile of consumption responses and their systematic covariation with observables.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20190211,Andreas Fagereng; Martin B.

"The paper assesses gender differences in pre-labor market specialization among the college-educated and highlights how those differences have evolved over time. Women choose majors with lower potential earnings (based on male wages associated with those majors) and subsequently sort into occupations with lower potential earnings given their major choice. These differences have narrowed over time, but recent cohorts of women still choose majors and occupations with lower potential earnings. Differences in undergraduate major choice explain a substantive portion of gender wage gaps for the college-educated above and beyond simply controlling for occupation.

"How does one's place of residence affect individual behavior and long-run outcomes? Understanding neighborhood and place effects has been a leading question for social scientists during the past half-century.

This paper summarizes the recent neighborhood effects literature and interprets the findings. Childhood neighborhoods affect long-run economic and educational outcomes in a manner consistent with exposure models of neighborhood effects. For adults, neighborhood environments matter for their health and well-being but have more ambiguous impacts on labor market outcomes.

"The fourfold increase in opioid deaths between 2000 and 2017 rivals even the COVID-19 pandemic as a health crisis for America. Why did it happen? Measures of demand for pain relief¡ªphysical pain and despair¡ªare high and in many cases rising, but their increase was nowhere near as large as the increase in deaths. The primary shift is in supply, primarily of new forms of allegedly safer narcotics. These new pain relievers flowed in greater volume to areas with more physical pain and mental health impairment, but since their apparent safety was an illusion, opioid deaths followed. By the end of the 2000s, restrictions on legal opioids led to further supply-side innovations, which created the burgeoning illegal market that accounts for the bulk of opioid deaths today. Because opioid use is easier to start than end, America's opioid epidemic is likely to persist for some time.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.35.4.171,David M. Cutler; Edward L.

"The twenty-first century has been a period of rising inequality in both income and health. In this paper, we find that geographic inequality in mortality for midlife Americans increased by about 70 percent between 1992 and 2016. This was not simply because states like New York or California benefited from having a high fraction of college-educated residents who enjoyed the largest health gains during the last several decades. Nor was higher dispersion in mortality caused entirely by the increasing importance of ""deaths of despair,"" or by rising spatial income inequality during the same period. Instead, over time, state-level mortality has become increasingly correlated with state-level income; in 1992, income explained only 3 percent of mortality inequality, but by 2016, state-level income explained 58 percent. These mortality patterns are consistent with the view that high-income states in 1992 were better able to enact public health strategies and adopt behaviors that, over the next quarter-century, resulted in pronounced relative declines in mortality. The substantial longevity gains in high-income states led to greater cross-state inequality in mortality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.35.4.123,Benjamin K.

"A large social science research literature examines the effects of prisons on crime and socioeconomic inequality, but the penal institution itself is often a black box overlooked in the analysis of its effects. This paper examines prisons and their role in rehabilitative programs and as venues for violence, health and healthcare, and extreme isolation through solitary confinement. Research shows that incarcerated people are participating less today than in the 1980s in prison programs, and they face high risks of violence, disease, and isolation. Prison conditions suggest the mechanisms that impair adjustment to community life after release provide a more complete account of the costs of incarceration and indicate the performance of prisons as moral institutions that bear a responsibility for humane and decent treatment.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.35.4.97,Bruce Western,35 (4): 97-122,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/657,,DOI: 10.1257/jep.35.4.97,Journal of Economic Perspectives,"Inside the Box: Safety, Health, and Isolation in Prison"

"In this article, we review a growing empirical literature on the effectiveness and fairness of the US pretrial system and discuss its policy implications. Despite the importance of this stage of the criminal legal process, researchers have only recently begun to explore how the pretrial system balances individual rights and public interests. We describe the empirical challenges that have prevented progress in this area and how recent work has made use of new data sources and quasi-experimental approaches to credibly estimate both the individual harms (such as loss of employment or government assistance) and public benefits (such as preventing non-appearance at court and new crimes) of cash bail and pretrial detention. These new data and approaches show that the current pretrial system imposes substantial short- and long-term economic harms on detained defendants in terms of lost earnings and government assistance, while providing little in the way of decreased criminal activity for the public interest. Non-appearances at court do significantly decrease for detained defendants, but the magnitudes cannot justify the economic harms to individuals observed in the data. A second set of studies shows that that the costs of cash bail and pretrial detention are disproportionately borne by Black and Hispanic individuals, giving rise to large and unfair racial differences in cash bail and detention that cannot be explained by underlying differences in pretrial misconduct risk.

"The efficiency of any police action depends on the relative magnitude of its crime-reducing benefits and legitimacy costs. Policing strategies that are socially efficient at the city level may be harmful at the local level, because the distribution of direct costs and benefits of police actions that reduce victimization is not the same as the distribution of indirect benefits of feeling safe. In the United States, the local misallocation of police resources is disproportionately borne by Black and Hispanic individuals. Despite the complexity of this particular problem, the incentives facing both police departments and police officers tend to be structured as if the goals of policing were simple¡ªto reduce crime by as much as possible. Formal data collection on the crime-reducing benefits of policing, and not the legitimacy costs, produces further incentives to provide more engagement than may be efficient in any specific encounter, at both the officer and departmental level.

Exploiting firm-level variation in the propensity to absorb workers, I estimate relative expansions in manufacturing output in more flexible labor markets.

"A central issue in designing incentive contracts is the decision to reward agents' input use versus outputs. The trade-off between risk and return to innovation in production can also lead agents with varying skill levels to perform differentially under different contracts.

We find that both contract types achieve comparable reductions in postpartum hemorrhage rates, but payments for outputs were four times that of inputs. Providers with varying qualifications performed equivalently under input incentives, while providers with advanced qualifications may have performed better under output contracts.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20190220,Manoj Mohanan; Katherine Donato; Grant Miller; Yulya Truskinovsky; Marcos Vera-Hern¨¢ndez,13 (4): 34-69,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/650,,DOI: 10.1257/app.20190220,American Economic Journal: Applied Economics,Different Strokes for Different Folks?

"This paper studies the electoral consequences of television stardom through the career of Ronald Reagan. I utilize quasi-experimental variation in television reception to estimate the causal effect of celebrity exposure on political support. I find that Reagan's tenure as the host of a 1950s entertainment television program translated into support for his candidacy, in terms of votes and political donations, nearly two decades after the show's first airing. Placebo checks suggest that this impact is not driven by unobserved heterogeneity or omitted variable bias. The effect was especially pronounced in the 1976 Republican primary elections relative to the general presidential elections and partially dissipated in locations where Reagan was a known political entity. Using the American National Election Studies (ANES) surveys, I provide evidence on possible mechanisms. Consistent with rational updating, nonpolitical media increased voters' assessment of Reagan's character and leadership, personalizing political considerations in elections featuring him.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20190147,Heyu Xiong,13 (4): 1-33,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/650,,DOI: 10.1257/app.20190147,American Economic Journal: Applied Economics,The Political Premium of Television Celebrity

"We investigate the effect of teenage driving on mortality and risky behaviors in the United States using a regression discontinuity design. We estimate that total mortality rises by 5.84 deaths per 100,000 (15 percent) at the minimum legal driving age cutoff, driven by an increase in motor vehicle fatalities of 4.92 deaths per 100,000 (44 percent). We also find that poisoning deaths, which are caused primarily by drug overdoses, rise by 0.31 deaths per 100,000 (29 percent) at the cutoff and that this effect is concentrated among females. Our findings show that teenage driving contributes to sex differences in risky drug use behaviors.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20200653,Jason Huh; Julian Reif,3 (4): 523-39,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/659,,DOI: 10.1257/aeri.20200653,American Economic Review: Insights,"Teenage Driving, Mortality, and Risky Behaviors"
"We study optimal dynamic lockdowns against COVID-19 within a commuting network. Our framework integrates canonical spatial epidemiology and trade models and is applied to cities with varying initial viral spread: Seoul, Daegu, and the New York City metropolitan area (NYM). Spatial lockdowns achieve substantially smaller income losses than uniform lockdowns. In the NYM and Daegu¡ªwith large initial shocks¡ªthe optimal lockdown restricts inflows to central districts before gradual relaxation, while in Seoul it imposes low temporal but large spatial variation. Actual commuting reductions were too weak in central locations in Daegu and the NYM and too strong across Seoul.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20200401,Pablo D.

"We study targeted lockdowns in a multigroup SIR model where infection, hospitalization, and fatality rates vary between groups¡ªin particular between the ""young,"" the ""middle-aged,"" and the ""old."" Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis of optimal policy. For baseline parameter values for the COVID-19 pandemic applied to the US, we find that optimal policies differentially targeting risk/age groups significantly outperform optimal uniform policies and most of the gains can be realized by having stricter protective measures such as lockdowns on the more vulnerable, old group. Intuitively, a strict and long lockdown for the old both reduces infections and enables less strict lockdowns for the lower-risk groups.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20200590,Daron Acemoglu; Victor Chernozhukov; Iv¨¢n Werning; Michael D.

"This paper studies the long-run effects of a ""big-push"" program providing a large asset transfer to the poorest Indian households. In a randomized controlled trial that follows these households over ten years, we find positive effects on consumption (0.6 SD), food security (0.1 SD), income (0.3 SD), and health (0.2 SD). These effects grow for the first seven years following the transfer and persist until year ten. One main channel for persistence is that treated households take better advantage of opportunities to diversify into more lucrative wage employment, especially through migration.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20200667,Abhijit Banerjee; Esther Duflo; Garima Sharma,3 (4): 471-86,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/659,,DOI: 10.1257/aeri.20200667,American Economic Review: Insights,Long-Term Effects of the Targeting the Ultra Poor Program

We demonstrate that agents with recursive preferences may systematically prefer one allocation mechanism to the other, even among mechanisms that are considered to be the same in standard models, in the sense that they induce the same probability distribution over successful matchings.

"Existing empirical work raises the hypothesis that performance pay¡ªwhatever its output gains¡ªmay widen the gender earnings gap because women may respond less to incentives. We evaluate this possibility by aggregating evidence from existing experiments on performance incentives with male and female subjects. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, we estimate both the average effect and heterogeneity across studies. We find that the gender response difference is close to zero and heterogeneity across studies is small, while performance pay increases output by 0.36 standard deviations on average.

What is the largest ""fake"" correlation that a misspecified model can generate, even when it passes an elementary misspecification test? We study an ""analyst"" who fits a model, represented by a directed acyclic graph, to an objective (multivariate) Gaussian distribution. We characterize the maximal estimated pairwise correlation for generic Gaussian objective distributions, subject to the constraint that the estimated model preserves the marginal distribution of any individual variable.

"This paper uses a direct-projections approach to estimate the effect of capital gains taxation on realizations at the state level and then develops a framework for determining revenue-maximizing rates at the federal level. We find that the elasticity of revenues with respect to the tax rate over a 10-year period is ¨C0.5 to ¨C0.3, indicating that capital gains tax cuts do not pay for themselves and that a 5 percentage point rate increase would yield $18 to $30 billion in annual federal tax revenue.

"This article synthesizes the large literature regarding the role of various players in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) securitization at the center of the 2008¨C09 US housing and financial crisis. Underwriting banks facilitated wide-scale mortgage fraud by knowingly misreporting key loan characteristics underlying mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under the cover of complexity, credit rating agencies catered to investment banks by issuing increasingly inflated ratings on both RMBS and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Originators who engaged in mortgage fraud gained market share, as did CDO managers who catered to underwriters by accepting the lowest-quality MBS collateral. Appraisal targeting and inflated appraisals were the norm. RMBS and CDO prices indicate that the marginal AAA investor was unaware of pervasive mortgage fraud and ratings inflation, but these factors were strongly related to future deal performance. The supply of fraudulent credit was not uniform, but clustered in certain geographic regions and zip codes. As these dubious originators extended credit to those who could not afford the loans, the credit expansion led to house price booms and subsequent crashes in these zip codes. Overall, a consistent narrative based on substantial research indicates that conflicts of interest, misreporting, and fraud were focal features of the financial crisis.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20201602,John M.

"Counting conservatively, data show about 100 million mass atrocity-related deaths since 1900. A distinct empirical phenomenon, mass atrocities are events of enormous scale, severity, and brutality, occur in wartime and in peacetime, are geographically widespread, occur with surprising frequency, under various systems of governance, and can be long-lasting in their effects on economic and human development, wellbeing, and wealth, more so when nonfatal physical injuries and mental trauma also are considered. As such, mass atrocities are a major economic concern. Given the multi-disciplinary nature of the subject matter, the pertinent conceptual, theoretical, and empirical literatures are voluminous and widely dispersed, and have not been synthesized before from an economics point of view. We address two gaps: a ""mass atrocities gap"" in the economics literature and an ""economics gap"" in mass atrocities scholarship. Our goals are, first, to survey and synthesize for economists a broad sweep of literatures on which to base further work in this field and, second, for both economists and noneconomists to learn how economic inquiry contributes to understanding the causes and conduct of mass atrocities and, possibly, to their mitigation and prevention. In drawing on standard, behavioral, identity, social network, and complex systems economics, we find that the big puzzles of the ""how"" and ""why"" of mass atrocities, and mass participation therein, are being well addressed. While new research on such topics will be valuable, work should also progress to develop improved prevention approaches.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20201458,Charles H.

"After China's recent great success in eliminating absolute poverty, addressing relative income inequality becomes a more important issue. This survey finds that income inequality rapidly increased in the first three decades since 1978 but stabilized and slightly declined in the past decade, consistent with the well-known Kuznets hypothesis. In addition to documenting the trend and patterns over time and across groups and regions, seven sources of income inequality are systematically discussed with an effort to reconcile and extend the existing literature. Furthermore, a negative correlation is documented between income inequality and intergenerational mobility, consistent with the Great Gatsby curve observed in developed countries.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20201495,Junsen Zhang,59 (4): 1191-1239,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/660,,DOI: 10.1257/jel.20201495,Journal of Economic Literature,A Survey on Income Inequality in China
"This article provides guidance on how to evaluate and improve the forecasting ability of models in the presence of instabilities, which are widespread in economic time series. Empirically relevant examples include predicting the financial crisis of 2007¨C08, as well as, more broadly, fluctuations in asset prices, exchange rates, output growth, and inflation. In the context of unstable environments, I discuss how to assess models' forecasting ability; how to robustify models' estimation; and how to correctly report measures of forecast uncertainty. Importantly, and perhaps surprisingly, breaks in models' parameters are neither necessary nor sufficient to generate time variation in models' forecasting performance: thus, one should not test for breaks in models' parameters, but rather evaluate their forecasting ability in a robust way. In addition, local measures of models' forecasting performance are more appropriate than traditional, average measures.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.20201479,Barbara Rossi,59 (4): 1135-90,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/660,,DOI: 10.1257/jel.20201479,Journal of Economic Literature,Forecasting in the Presence of Instabilities: How We Know Whether Models Predict Well and How to Improve Them

"We present a new estimator for causal effects with panel data that builds on insights behind the widely used difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods. Relative to these methods we find, both theoretically and empirically, that this ""synthetic difference-in-differences"" estimator has desirable robustness properties, and that it performs well in settings where the conventional estimators are commonly used in practice. We study the asymptotic behavior of the estimator when the systematic part of the outcome model includes latent unit factors interacted with latent time factors, and we present conditions for consistency and asymptotic normality.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20190159,Dmitry Arkhangelsky; Susan Athey; David A.

"A proposer requires a veto player's approval to change a status quo. Proposer is uncertain about Vetoer's preferences. We show that Vetoer is typically given a non-singleton menu, or delegation set, of options to pick from. The optimal set balances the extent of compromise with the risk of a veto. We identify conditions for certain delegation sets to emerge, including ""full delegation"": Vetoer can choose any action between the status quo and Proposer's ideal action.

Results from a series of experiments that compare M equilibrium to leading behavioral game theory models demonstrate its virtues in predicting observed choices and stated beliefs.

"We formalize the editorial role of news media in a multisector economy and show that media can be an independent source of business cycle fluctuations, even when they report accurate information. Public reporting about a subset of sectoral developments that are newsworthy but unrepresentative causes firms across all sectors to hire too much or too little labor. We construct historical measures of US sectoral news coverage and use them to calibrate our model.

We show that when Indonesia moved top regional firms into ""medium taxpayer offices,"" with high staff-to-taxpayer ratios, tax revenue more than doubled.

"We explore how firms grow by adding products. We leverage detailed data from Japan's cotton spinning industry at the turn of the last century to do so. This setting allows us to fully characterize the type of differentiation (vertical or horizontal) of new product introductions as well as whether the product is within or outside of the firm's prior technological capabilities. We find that trying to introduce innovative products beyond the firm's previous technologically feasible set, even if such trials fail, is a key to firm growth. Indeed, it mostly facilitates growth through the firm's later success in horizontal product diversification. In long-term outcomes, the right tail of the firm size distribution becomes dominated by firms that first moved into technologically challenging products and then later applied their newly acquired technical competence to horizontal expansion of their product portfolios. Two mechanisms through which this knowledge transfer occurs are greater production system flexibility and higher product appeal to downstream buyers.",https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20201656,Serguey Braguinsky; Atsushi Ohyama; Tetsuji Okazaki; Chad Syverson,111 (12): 3795-3826,https://www.aeaweb.org/issues/658,,DOI: 10.1257/aer.20201656,American Economic Review,"Product Innovation, Product Diversification, and Firm Growth: Evidence from Japan's Early Industrialization"
